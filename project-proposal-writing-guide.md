# Project Proposal Writing Guide

## 1. Problem Statement
### Best Practices
* Write a concise and focused statement (1-2 sentences) that immediately captures the core challenge
* Clearly identify the specific gap or limitation in current approaches or knowledge
* Use precise, unambiguous language while avoiding excessive technical jargon
* Frame the problem in terms of practical challenges that need to be addressed
* Ensure the statement is specific enough to be actionable but broad enough to be significant

### Key Components
* Current limitation or challenge
* Specific impact of the problem
* Clear indication of what needs to be solved

## 2. Motivation
### Best Practices
* Expand on why solving this problem matters to the field and broader community
* Connect the specific problem to broader impacts and potential applications
* Provide detailed explanation of current limitations and their implications
* Highlight both immediate and long-term benefits of solving the problem
* Include both practical and theoretical motivations for the work
* Support claims with concrete examples or scenarios where possible

### Key Components
* Broader impact statement
* Current limitations and their effects
* Potential benefits and applications
* Stakeholder considerations
* Connection to existing work or systems

## 3. Proposed Method
### Best Practices
* Present a clear, numbered structure that shows the logical flow of your approach
* Break down complex processes into discrete, manageable steps
* Include both high-level overview and specific implementation details
* Use hierarchical organization to show relationships between main steps and sub-steps
* Explain the rationale behind each major methodological choice
* Demonstrate how different steps connect to solve the overall problem

### Key Components
* Overview of approach
* Step-by-step breakdown
* Sub-steps for complex procedures
* Rationale for methodological choices
* Connection between steps

## 4. Experiment Plan
### Best Practices
* Provide detailed, actionable steps for implementing the proposed method
* Include specific criteria and requirements for each component
* Address practical implementation considerations and requirements
* Consider potential challenges and how they will be addressed
* Include clear metrics for measuring success
* Specify necessary tools, resources, and infrastructure
* Use clear organization with bullet points or numbered lists

### Key Components
* Detailed implementation steps
* Success criteria and metrics
* Resource requirements
* Technical specifications
* Testing procedures
* Data collection and analysis plans

## 5. Test Cases
### Best Practices
* Start with simple, straightforward test cases to validate basic functionality
* Include multiple scenarios of varying complexity
* Provide specific examples with expected outcomes
* Include edge cases and potential failure modes
* Show progression from simple to complex scenarios
* Document expected behavior for each test case

### Key Components
* Basic functionality tests
* Complex scenario tests
* Edge case examples
* Invalid input handling
* Expected outcomes
* Progression of complexity

## 6. Fallback Plan
### Best Practices
* Identify potential failure points in the proposed approach
* Provide alternative approaches for critical components
* Include systematic debugging and troubleshooting strategies
* Break down complex problems into manageable components
* Address each system component separately
* Outline clear steps for investigating and resolving issues
* Include contingency plans for major risks

### Key Components
* Risk identification
* Alternative approaches
* Debugging strategies
* Component-level analysis
* Systematic troubleshooting steps
* Contingency measures

## Overall Structure Guidelines
### Document Organization
* Maintain logical flow between sections
* Ensure each section builds upon previous content
