## Preface
This document is intended to lay out my expectations for people working in my research group or interested in such. In the spirit of good communication, it reflects discussions with individuals and in several group meetings held over the years and it is constantly evolving – which is why it will always be labeled “Draft.” Please read it and if there is anything that doesn’t make sense or that you think is in any way not the right expectation, then let me know – I am happy to discuss any aspect at any time, individually or as a group. Nothing is unchangeable, but I ask you to respect the process and abide by the expectations as written here unless we have had an explicit conversation that agrees to some change.

*This is adapted from Prof. Grace Gao, Prof. John Boothroyd, and Prof. Emily Puckett.*

## Becoming A Lab Member
Over the past few years, we have received multiple requests on whether someone can be identified as a lab member to SALT, and broadly to the Stanford NLP Group. Here are a few criteria to lay out what it means to be a lab member:

- If you are a postdoc or a Ph.D. student, advised or co-advised by Diyi, then you are a member of the SALT Lab automatically.
- If you are a master’s or undergraduate student, you are a member of the lab only if you are:
  1. Conducting research with SALT lab members for over a quarter.
  2. Attending regular lab meetings and actively engaging with the lab.

## Finding A Project
Two brains are better than one, especially when creativity is the task. My hope is that everyone will engage in a period of intense and collaborative thinking when they join the lab and periodically thereafter to conceive of a project that is:
- Original
- Important
- Interesting
- Complements other projects in the lab
- Meshes with the overall direction of the group and its funding base

I will help shape the project to meet these goals and expect each person in the lab to provide the creative spark behind their respective projects.

## Work Ethics and Hours
We maintain high work integrity. Our publications need to state the truth.  
No plagiarism is allowed, including self-plagiarism.  

I expect all to be self-motivated, and for the number of hours worked never to be an issue. A flexible time schedule is one of the many perks of our lifestyle. I ask, however, that all be in the lab (either at Stanford or at GaTech) for at least a majority of most workdays starting from this year (2024) so that interaction with your colleagues can occur for their and your benefit.

Although Prof. Yang may sometimes send out emails at night or on the weekend, you are not expected to reply or work outside of regular work hours. However, you are expected to reply to Prof. Yang’s email within one business day, even if it is just a simple response, such as “I got your email, and I’ll work on it.”

## Group Culture, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We aim to have a nurturing and supportive group culture. We treat everyone equally and with respect. We welcome and support people regardless of their race, color, national or ethnic origin, class, sex, gender identity or expression, LGBTQ+ identity, age, disability, religion, veteran status, marital status, parenthood, or any other family circumstance.

## Meetings and Communication
### Google Drive Folder
- We use the Google Drive folder to document all research progress, including meeting notes, papers/presentations, relevant literature, etc.

### Weekly Group Meeting
- Since we aim to run the group meetings efficiently, please be on time.
- We expect all SALT Lab members—which includes all postdocs, (co-advised) Ph.D. students, as well as lab members—to attend the lab meeting unless there are specific circumstances and if so, you will need to notify the lab meeting organizer.

### Weekly Individual Meetings
- I meet Ph.D. students once a week individually. To make the meetings efficient and to have weekly documentation of your work, please prepare meeting notes in advance and have your meeting notes sent to me the day before.
- MS and undergraduate students can set up weekly meetings with their mentors and myself.

The meeting notes should cover:
- Research progress for the past week
- Things to be discussed
- Interesting seminars attended/papers read
- Short-term/mid-term/long-term milestones, including both urgent and important tasks
- [Meeting Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yVPhaDb4j2-RV13EEPVczsj14bebxUIGBNf9zKwpvdY/edit)
- [Advising Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FJUQDAWrYE13ueD0oiKKAJJkkkeHIUIWP0NHfpKte40/edit?usp=sharing)

I understand that research is not a linear process, and there can be seemingly more productive and less productive weeks.

### Subgroup Meetings
- Depending on the needs and constraints of other collaborators, there will be subgroup meetings on a research project or topic, scheduled separately.

### Taking a Walk with Diyi
- I offer walks with students who may need discussion or advice from me on issues like a career path, how to prepare for interviews/career/faculty jobs, etc. Early morning/late afternoon is the best time to schedule walks with me because it’s easier to fit into my schedule.

### Year-End Reflection
- Students fill out an annual year-end reflection form to reflect on personal growth and achievements, near-term and long-term goals, group culture, etc., followed by an individual meeting with me. Year-end reflections are meant as a positive personal and group-building experience, and the primary goal is to effect lasting and positive change to your career trajectory and work life.
- We will start this by the end of this academic year.

### Annual Anonymous Lab Culture Survey/Discussion
- We run annual anonymous lab culture survey/discussion sessions from time to time to understand and improve our lab culture.

---

## Personal Leave
- Please let me know three weeks in advance if you will be out of the lab for more than three days for personal leave unless there are specific circumstances.

---

## SALT Lab Mailing List
- We use the mailing list (salt-members@lists.stanford.edu) to send information, such as group meetings and relevant seminars.

## Publications
Authorship:
- We follow all the IJME rules for authorship rules:
  1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work
  2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content
  3. Final approval of the version to be published
  4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

Projects evolve over time; thus, authorship inclusion and author order will be re-evaluated accordingly.  

Talking about authorship with your teammates is professional and recommended.  
Please talk to the team about authorship first before putting people’s names on a paper.

- A polished full draft needs to be provided to Prof. Yang at least one week in advance of the submission deadline.
- GitHub codes/data: Codes/data associated with publications must be open-source, with exceptions discussed case-by-case.
- Corresponding Author: Prof. Yang will be the corresponding author (or last author) unless specific circumstances arise.

## Collaboration
Collaboration within and outside of the research group is highly encouraged.  
Inform Prof. Yang of all stages of collaboration.  
The culture of encouraging collaboration does not mean you should get your name on as many projects as possible. Commit only if the mutual fit benefits all parties.

All equipment purchases and material require pre-approval by Prof. Yang.
