# Knowledge Module Template 
This repository is meant to serve as a general template for how to set up new knowledge modules. Each module is currently set up using a Markdown file which must include a title and then any additional information. 

See `example.md` as an example for how the file must be formatted. 

To add a module to your Knoll extension, click the + button on the upper left corner. Then, you can input the URL to the `.md` file that you have created.
